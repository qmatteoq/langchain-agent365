# LangChain Sample Agent - Python

This sample demonstrates how to build an agent using LangChain in Python with the Microsoft Agent 365 SDK. It covers:

- **Observability**: End-to-end tracing, caching, and monitoring for agent applications
- **Notifications**: Services and models for managing user notifications
- **Tools**: Model Context Protocol tools for building advanced agent solutions
- **Hosting Patterns**: Hosting with Microsoft 365 Agents SDK

This sample uses the [Microsoft Agent 365 SDK for Python](https://github.com/microsoft/Agent365-python).

For comprehensive documentation and guidance on building agents with the Microsoft Agent 365 SDK, including how to add tooling, observability, and notifications, visit the [Microsoft Agent 365 Developer Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-agent-365/developer/).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Microsoft Agent 365 SDK
- LangChain
- Azure/OpenAI API credentials

## Working with User Identity

On every incoming message, the A365 platform populates `activity.from_property` with basic user
information — always available with no API calls or token acquisition:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `activity.from_property.id` | Channel-specific user ID (e.g., `29:1AbcXyz...` in Teams) |
| `activity.from_property.name` | Display name as known to the channel |
| `activity.from_property.aad_object_id` | Azure AD Object ID — use this to call Microsoft Graph |

The sample logs these fields at the start of every message turn and injects the display name
into the LLM system instructions for personalized responses.

## Handling Agent Install and Uninstall

When a user installs (hires) or uninstalls (removes) the agent, the A365 platform sends an `InstallationUpdate` activity — also referred to as the `agentInstanceCreated` event. The sample handles this in `on_installation_update` in `host_agent_server.py`:

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `add` | Agent was installed — send a welcome message |
| `remove` | Agent was uninstalled — send a farewell message |

```python
if action == "add":
    await context.send_activity("Thank you for hiring me! Looking forward to assisting you in your professional journey!")
elif action == "remove":
    await context.send_activity("Thank you for your time, I enjoyed working with you.")
```

To test with Agents Playground, use **Mock an Activity → Install application** to send a simulated `installationUpdate` activity.

## Message Delivery in Teams

This sample sends a single final reply for each incoming user message.

This is intentional: some channels are less reliable when a turn sends multiple intermediate replies such as acknowledgments or typing indicators before the final response. The host therefore waits for the agent result and sends one final `send_activity(...)` call from [host_agent_server.py](host_agent_server.py).

## Running the Agent

To set up and test this agent, refer to the [Configure Agent Testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-agent-365/developer/testing?tabs=python) guide for complete instructions.

For a detailed explanation of the agent code and implementation, see the [Agent Code Walkthrough](AGENT-CODE-WALKTHROUGH.md).
